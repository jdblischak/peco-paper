### Introduction

Cell cycle phase and cell types - among many reasons - are argubly the most candidates driving differences in gene expression among cells. 

__peco__ is a supervised approach for predicting _continuous_ cell cycle phase in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis. 

We developed __peco__ in a study that combined fluorescence imaging with scRNA-seq to measure cell cycle phase and gene expression levels in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
