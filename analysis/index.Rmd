### Introduction

Cell cycle phase and cell types - among many reasons - are argubly the most candidates driving differences in gene expression among cells. 

__peco__ is a supervised approach for predicting _continuous_ cell cycle phase in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis. 

We developed __peco__ in a study that combined fluorescence imaging with scRNA-seq to measure cell cycle phase and gene expression levels in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). 


* Our paper: [Characterizing and inferring quantitative cell-cycle phase in single-cell RNA-seq data analysis](doi.org/10.1101/526848).

* Our software: 


### Software

* [peco 0.99.0](https://github.com/jhsiao999/peco) is submitted and pending review on Bioconductor.

The development version can be downloaded from GitHub

```{r, eval=F}
devtools::install_github("jhsiao999/peco")
library(peco)
```


### Data access

* GEO record [GSE121265](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE121265) 
for all raw and processed sequencing data

* The processed data data sets are also available in as a gzip compressed 
tarball on the [Gilad lab website](https://giladlab.uchicago.edu/data/): https://giladlab.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Hsiao_et_al_2019.tar.gz.

* All data sets used in our analysis are listed and downloadable at https://jdblischak.github.io/fucci-seq/data-overview.html.
