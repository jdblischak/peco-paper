## Overview

__peco__ is a supervised approach for predicting _continuous_ cell cycle phase using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. 


## The approach

We quantified continous cell cycle phase using FUCCI fluorescence imaging and trained peco to predict this continuous cell cycle phase using scRNA-seq data collected from six human cell lines. 
[Our paper](doi.org/10.1101/526848) showed that peco produces robust cell cycle phase predictions using strong cyclic genes - genes which expression levels oscillate along the cell cycle. 


## The software

__peco__ will be released in Biconductor 3.11.

The development version is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jhsiao999/peco). To install the development version,

```{r, eval=F}
devtools::install_github("jhsiao999/peco")
library(peco)
```

## Data access 

We store the data as `singleCellExperiment` objects (require `singleCellExperiment` package).

* GEO record [GSE121265](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE121265) 
for all raw and processed sequencing data.

* We also provide the processed data in TXT format as a gzip compressed 
tarball on the [Gilad lab website](https://giladlab.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Hsiao_et_al_2019.tar.gz).
